What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library focused on computer vision, image processing, and real-time operations. It is written in C++ but has Python bindings, making it highly popular in the Python ecosystem.

OpenCV is widely used in fields like:

Image and Video Processing: Manipulating images and videos, detecting objects, and applying filters.

Machine Learning: Face detection, object recognition, and tracking.

Augmented Reality: Overlaying digital content on real-world objects.

Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles: Enabling machines to perceive and interpret visual data.

Installation
To install OpenCV in Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless  # For environments without GUI support
pip install opencv-contrib-python  # For additional functionality like SIFT, SURF
Core Features of OpenCV
Image Processing:

Reading, writing, and displaying images.

Image transformations like resizing, cropping, rotation, and flipping.

Color space conversions (e.g., BGR â†” HSV).

Filtering (e.g., Gaussian Blur, Edge Detection).

Video Processing:

Reading, writing, and displaying video streams.

Frame-by-frame processing.

Object tracking in videos.

Object Detection and Recognition:

Detection of features (e.g., edges, corners).

Face detection using Haar cascades or DNN models.

Object detection using YOLO, SSD, etc.

Geometric Transformations:

Perspective transformation.

Affine transformation.

Warping images.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Integration:

Built-in support for classical machine learning models.

Integration with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Real-Time Capabilities:

Processing live video streams.

Using OpenCV with hardware acceleration.
